00:00
Thanks guys.
00:14
Need to go.
00:23
Really, really good. My flag came down. You had a flag on your kingdom and made. This was his building and his kingdom and it competed against his mom being alive and moms kingdom was over here. What do you think about that? I believe what guys tell you say bye then.
00:57
Because there was a kingdom over here. Oh, a little, listen to the idea. And then there was a kingdom there, go. See if you can find the pieces of the kingdom or do you have a different idea to opportunity? But it came to me there and over here. And I here, I don't know if you have, let's hear what you're here.
01:24
And make you think, Oh, to help you build his food. Did you see that? That the kingdom got destroyed? Yeah, I and so what's your idea about the destroyed? Kingdom will make it. I'm gonna Put the, can you oh, what a great idea. So, your thought is that you're gonna bring a construction site, truck over to the kingdom to help fix it.
01:54
Is that right? Yeah. Oh, I can't hear you. Oh pieces, too. Let me see us to go with it. And we need an unmagnetal piece to go with it. Don't give up now. You don't think so? Okay, Thank you. I'll bring it over Well and a big piece of my thing.
02:38
Yeah let's see. You have to see you Looks like you look like Wonder Woman today. Wonderful. It's a perfect day. After the long beach. Yeah. What do you think you're in? Do we need these for those pieces? Don't? Oh, I asked you something what? Right particular all over the place.
03:11
So that Well yeah, one already great idea. It looks like this was an important part of it and it felt hot during the war. The two kingdoms had a battle and the kingdoms got destroyed but it really has the construction vehicles here to help fix the kingdoms.
03:54
And you think oh, Julian the president. Yeah, when we fixed the kingdoms. Do they want to have another battle? Yeah. Okay. Fine. You know, we're getting ready for a new battle so that we're going to use the construction vehicles to repair the kingdoms and then have a new.
04:23
This must be the other kingdom on this side, you can. So I'll put these pieces here that construction bagel can come in fit. You've got a good idea. Yeah. All right. Cool.
04:42
Which kingdom do you think that postcard or that side? Oh yeah, that's a good thing. I like that. I Now then the friend that I met, he said this course, goes to this kingdom. This tiger belongs to them, but they capture the target. Where do you think the? Why do they capture the child?
05:07
Participants. That's actually the tiger from the other kingdom. And then, so maybe this was do think that was where the tiger was trapped. I'm gonna fix the place where they captured and trapped the tiger. No, you have a different idea making. What bigger? This is the have to move part of this kingdom's castle.
05:35
We need to be bigger. This is for exactly what.
05:54
Okay. Now you're getting the other. You know what? And put this be Some happy. Friend is saying hello. Just this could make a big barrier between the two things figure out how to put that back together.
06:32
That's a little, like, a good castle for that kingdom. What do you think with me? Yeah, part of the battle between the kingdom. Yeah, you know how to be part of the to hear what you You can ask.
07:11
Oh, that's really good.
07:21
Good building. Now that's ready. Okay, that one looks ready. Where were you think they captured this from? The other kingdom? Is this the cage? They were keeping him in. Does it need another fencer? Something around it. This is the driver. That's the driver a second.
07:53
Okay. Do you want to so the horse go inside the console or outside. Oh. And where's the queen? Where's the queen of that can go? Or maybe the king, I don't know.
08:13
In the she's on the lookout there. That's a good lookout spot, Julian. I'd an idea can miss you to look out spot over here. And who's gonna look be the lookout person for this castle? Hello, everyone. Okay, so this one is the royalty of this finger and she the royalty of that.
08:41
Is this guys, this one to break the other castles. All right, so before the battle happened, do you think should we use these as a barrier between the kingdoms? Yeah, but I'm not gonna have to go here. Wait, what was your idea? This truck couldn't the construction vehicle, the back of take that apart.
09:14
You know what? Oh no, hold on. Because the battle hasn't started. It has a battle started. Yeah. Oh, you didn't tell me yet. Hold on. Start again. You didn't tell me and we didn't have the barrier up yet. Okay. Oh before we I didn't know the battle started, I wasn't ready.
09:40
But is that her back up again? I just don't set up.
09:51
Is a fluid. A little boy bandage. You can leave as the weapons. Is that a good idea or do you have a different idea? That's a good idea. Okay, so we make some more stuff. Each side can have them. All right. So, make some more weapons.
10:23
What should we do? All right. Okay, we're good at fixing it so I think that's like that. I think you're right. And then there was or castle vehicle. I hold not. Wait a minute Julia. Oh, did you ask? Hey hey you want to make the vehicles? Oh no, you're telling me.
10:50
Come back and talk to me about the plan. Is that your pants? But we had a plan first to set up the two castles like, but that room. But in that identical open. Can you help me fix it first? No, because remember there was a lookout. What happened to the princess or the queen?
11:10
That was in the lookout. We need to fix that part and put and I remember that, oh, you're a good finder. Thanks. And then, the one other thing that the tiger that was captured was in page. And I don't see that the cage is the cage buffer, and can you fix the page?
11:29
And then we'll make the next plan, which I think you had an idea for them experience. Make some cards. Four. Both of the castles. Oh. So each castle needs a car for the battle. Is that your idea? Which I think that's one over here, right? Oh, hold on. We're not ready yet.
11:51
With this, just go here. And then, where was the tiger, right? So then much is about what kind of vehicle do we want for this. For each of the kingdoms, The construction vehicle is this belong to one kingdom or is this in the middle? Because it's both the six states.
12:11
Okay, great. Thanks after the idea. And then what are you thinking about for? What does this kingdom mean? What opens something between the Queen? And first I'm of all and which kingdom is gonna get this car back. Okay. So that and what type of cars this gonna be for the bad?
12:36
Our double wheeled car to help them to, and of course, with the double aile car, that puts over sitting up.
12:55
It's really you want to say. Hey. Hi. Remember, all the brothers names. Joseph Paul and Gabriel. Well, I don't understand. Oh Joseph and Gabriel and Paul. What you would do is when when new friends come Julian, it's helpful to to the whole system. So excited to play and here Hi Gabriel my jokes about waiting Jillian, tells you the exciting thing that's going on, It's really saying what's happening.
13:41
Tell them what's going on going back. And this kingdom is going to battle and you were just about to make what for each kingdom. Yeah, tell him each kingdom needs a vehicle, right? So then say hey Joseph do you want to make a musical for you making for the king?
14:22
How's really in that? I think Australian is that a good idea? Feel like that. I'm sure Joseph in the battle that way, If it flips at all, that put me through such a cool battle car because it can flip and keep going. Is what it is. This is the lookout.
14:47
Perhaps to look out on the side and say, Jose Joseph, can you find a lookout on the other side?
15:02
Hey, baby. Don't, you want us to wait for the battle to yield? Do you want to wait for us to do the battle? We'll get it all set up and then he could be closer.
15:21
It goes to us and you could have slide be part of the kingdom. Guys, what do you think? Oh, hold on. I think Joseph's wondering can this, yeah.
15:41
Well, I think that's it. That's good idea. Did you think we need another slide? Do you think we need another slide? Well, I'm gonna make another call. Tell her because we need it.
16:10
Okay, one truck reaches one.
16:28
Exactly says Julian. It's the barrier of the Queen. It looks like Paul showing you something. Oh Paul showing you something really high. That can be the back to the tire that. Hmm. I don't have a nice idea. It's really where. Should the ax go?
17:06
Okay. Good idea, actually.
17:29
What's an earlier? You know, what other and so what isn't stuff? Is that where you put the weapons? Yeah. Julian you show them where the weapons are. But you already make some weapons. Bring the car over to go, you can shop. Say, I'll show you the weapons.
17:53
And say, hey, say what? I right, that's a good point. Armory is a place that you store weapons as a pigeon, what were these? What is just basically put these buckles. There's some like, I think this Well I will be right back. I got to get a zip and water and well, when you come back Julian, we'll put, we'll find a place for all the weapons.
18:50
Don't know, when Julian comes back, you can ask me, what happened, what you doing, you better go ask him if you didn't hear me. I told you. You didn't hear what say hey. All right. We can go this morning after this morning and come back. Okay. Drilling, did you tell your friends?
19:10
They'll be right back because they have to When you're playing, it can make the third floor. You won't put the weapons away while you're gone Julie. And and then when you get back you guys can plan the armory. How does that sound? Oh, I don't like this tiger. You'll have to ask them about it when it gets back.
19:44
Well he'll tell you one of the best is part of. He'll tell you. What is two dogs for? But really, I'll tell you that too. When you get back, it's part of what set up. I'm looking for more weapons.
20:15
Computer. Oh computer. I get out of there. Two of them. Should there be one for each kingdom or what do you want to decide? What truly, and Paul and Julian is that to get lot.
21:10
So it's a definitely a video, five. And Paul is three people is seven, seven five three.
21:28
Right.
21:32
Hi, I'm back. Cool. That's Paul. Had an idea with. Did you want to show these to Julian? Yeah, these were going to be. What would you like, me? Are those weapons? Or were those the computer's weapons or more weapons? This is the weapons area over here because I want to set those up weapon.
21:55
It's actually a jackpot. So yeah, Is it Jack cool?
22:06
Don't you guys need more one people? Good? Oh Julian I heard Joseph, ask you something you could say. What'd you say Julian overdose of Ashley? We're, I don't know. They were just in the bin. Hmm, hmm, Jillian. You want to check my lunch box to see if there's any any people in there that could work but we need that pink lunch box.
22:45
Yeah, show it to Joseph. They want to check this see if anything in there. Would work. Oh wow, this isn't part of the kingdom, what? We can use. But yeah, we can do that after the battle because the battles could win the game. But are there anything that can work for the people here?
23:12
Maybe this. You're right. What where should those guys come? That Joseph, what he thinks of you have?
23:27
The game. Is that a good idea? Yeah. Cool. So nice. Julian. Where are you? Putting your people that you found so does each kingdom have a? Does it have a robot? No. He's to our friends robots. I've seen a lot of Star Wars. Yeah. How to do two. And oh, does Julian know this ask can you know those guys you know these guys, no I know them, they're from Star Wars, I actually do know them but they do not do things.
24:07
What are you three people? Oh wait, this one is actually different and that one is it should they both be on what in one kingdom or on each kingdom each? Because you know why here you're actually friends. Friends, they are friends. So maybe part of the, when the battle happens, it will be to get them both on the same side.
24:48
Not a good idea. Oh, which one fell in the classroom. That is. Are you sure? Yeah. Ask us Joseph just in case say is this one? That's are two weeks old. Yeah, this is the The golden one is C3PO and the white one is gender.
25:30
To available.
25:36
I would block Today, like, this time to do that.
25:49
Roasted Where you at? You both had a brain pools at school. Did Duplo that school today, Where did you? But then you said, Joseph wearing yours. So where are yours at home? So it's something that you like that. They're in different places. How are the weapons coming out Julie and take a look over there with Joseph.
26:22
So those need more help getting more. It looks like not all of them are put together Apparently.
26:38
Oh, Julian, are you taking a break from weapon building? Are you guys going to do some dancing? Very well. Hey, I was trying to get in your Well, you got in my way, excuse.
27:02
Oh, you skipped the blue. Let's see. It's Joseph. Gonna skip the orange. What? I found It's oh maybe this marks where you should try to get money. Should just be the one you jump on or over you jump. Oh, okay. Close your eyes. Who's gonna go first? It's four people said me.
27:24
Hmm. Then who's gonna go second know. All right, so, then both of you get on this side, if you're both gonna go for it. And wherever I put it, you guys have to jump right in and decide together. Jump on it, okay? I think over right. We don't know where it is closely jump on the ground and it's the first you jump.
27:55
If the if and that doesn't have it on it, you jump on it. Is that has it on it. You jump over it. Now, open over open up. So jump on orange and over the blue on top Julianne Stern, jump on the orange. And oh my god. We did.
28:19
So, I'm good now ones now. Start first like now. All right, so, and then we can go afterwards. So, if Julian's, I think she only agrees he already has his eyes closed. Right? Okay. But you can't start standing on them or not. No size. It's a good idea opposite.
28:52
Okay, that organizer closed. One, two, three. Open your eyes. Oh, you're going through the whole time, jumpers. Oh, it's okay in this game. Yeah, everybody's having fun together. It looks like it looks like Joseph has a idea to change it instead of jumping straight. You're gonna turn in jump.
29:31
Turn it.
29:39
Ben jumps, and sometimes we bump into each other on skin jumps. And what do we do it again? Yeah, we just say sorry. Let's try again. Oh, okay. And we want, I don't know who you want to watch those trip or Paul who you saying, watch it to say, hey Joseph, watch this.
30:04
What this? Oh good. One. That's easy to tell the woman. That was a master available there. Oh Julian and Josephina break from the jumping game. That was a fun one. You do two ball? Yeah. I descended. Yes. Back and happened a flip jump. Yeah, It was a good flip jump.
30:41
There's a princess. Okay, here comes Is that the leap jump Juliet, Is that the next one to try the leap jump, right? That's just to do the leak jumping. It is a good idea. Go ask yourself. We one skill, right? I think you're telling the books instead of your friends say hey Joseph, look what we do we can actually make two.
31:11
Let's do keep your freaking tip too. Watch this, you run and leave. It's a call. The leap jump. Yeah. Oh, he missed the green and the orange with the leaf jump. Oh, to take the little practice sometimes to do the leaf jump. Whoa. You want to see this more?
31:40
Oh Julian. It sounds like Paul saying something. Say what? Paul, what? And and denture. Yeah, that's called the set called the leak jump.
32:00
After the leaf jump. I hear Dad. Julian. Also, let's look at another zipper was giving us some trouble. This morning. Is that ever happened to your zipper? Joseph, that it goes upside down. Yeah. And then we'll have plenty of water and we get home. Okay. Of course, we thank you.
32:27
You. Oh, Joseph has an idea. If you take out your jacket or not is thirsty, huh? Because you don't get as hot.
32:41
Forget. Yeah. Oh, that's okay. Yeah, he's trying to learn from you and Joseph. Yeah, it's cool. What a leap jump.
33:09
Looks like it's time to get ready for that battle. Again, you want to expel redness, you want to save the penny in your pocket just in case you want to take a leap jump. Break after we set it for the battle here. Let's be over. What happens with sunbreaks.
33:41
What can we do? What do you think? Julian foul more fell today? Oh, is it? Okay, Julie and making it fall on purpose. So you're trying to say you want to different game in the middle. Hold on. So we got to check in with Joseph and says, Wow, so then we can break it.
34:07
And or is it you want to make a call? So then you call the construction vehicles to fix it again.
34:21
Your job doesn't have any idea. Julian, whatever looks like here. What's your idea? You both agree me to make a tiger. Last time we had two separate kingdoms. Do you want to make one big kingdom? Is that you guys? This idea are different idea are watching this that is right here and I have another idea, make a big ramp, take a big grand.
34:50
Did you want to make a make sure? Okay. How can we make that tall one there?
35:15
Your idea is to be another part of which piece also helped me Terry. Can this be prepared in this part of? I was trying to make a taller over here. Do you like that idea? Did you want it to be at the bottom of it here? Okay. Well, to ask the boys, did you think we should put it taller or at the bottom of the ramp to make it?
35:39
Longer can put it total at the bottom of the app to make it longer. Do you guys have a brain mask? You guys agree. So right here. Okay, think about it. It looks like this, this this could make it so that the vehicles go down the ramp and crash into the kingdom.
36:07
A little. What do you think of that idea? No, not a good idea. You have a different idea. A good idea but hold on Julian what did Joseph think of the idea? Yeah he doesn't want you to crash. You can say what part. Don't you want me to crash you?
36:26
Okay. So thank you. Yes. The attract the tractor or the castle but the castle you're not gonna say anything else. But I really so like season you watching this video here. Okay. Just taking what do you need? You need that. You need the back of the car. Oh, I wonder what?
37:03
These two center have kind of things. Joseph. It looks like you've a really big idea. Notification is a really big idea. Yeah. So, what's your, How could we do, that Joseph's really big idea is to be bigger cats, make a bigger castle and Jillian's. Really big idea is to make a bigger ramp North.
37:34
That's making a bigger castle in Julian, is making a bigger ramp the bigger area. Okay. So, Paul is making a bigger landing bigger room. And Joseph is making a bigger castle. Cool. What Who were you asking to watch that Julian? Hey know, Hello.
38:22
Don't give up. Oh, maybe we're gonna jump over to Paul's Kingdom and put these right here to just Joseph's kingdom. Yeah, let's get this right on here. Hold yet. We need that place and that looks like a good jump.
39:22
That is it a better ramp or a better jump? Oh, It is, the car goes all the way after that, you might have an idea of how to make turn it from a jump from a ramp to a jump. All of them Julian was trying to make it jump off of it.
39:47
They joked if you have any ideas. Do you have any idea?
40:03
Oh, Gabriel has a question. Say, guess what happened? Yes. See what's your question? Don't know, we're just playing. So what happened?
40:22
And because what happened to it, all it got broke. I got destroyed. Yes. And now it's one big team and Well, Julian is making a tall. What? My life.
41:03
I don't know how it's gonna go.
41:12
It's not well, we have to decide when did not to have the battle anymore, right? Well.
41:28
The wind is it? Well you guys have to decide together. What's the plan plus the plan? It's amazing. Hi there. Can we make it so that this car can jump off this and land in the castle? It's just a photo shooting ready.
42:05
It's not horseshoes Every time you race versus car. Oh, I don't know. Well, you need to more than one kid doing it. Maybe Gabriel wants to see if he can get a vehicle that can go and see which one goes further. Oh, that's Julian. Yeah. Why does it have I have you that person?
42:49
Here Are there wheels for that one? And maybe little bit. I know that. That's what. No, that was okay well I think that the car versus a plane. The plane needs wheels before it can race you guys think. Or now and the show. And I see, I think Gabriel has some pieces that can help at Julian you, squirrel?
43:44
What? Good evening one. And decide together. Say one want to be here because this is the vehicle that I'm that I may be good. All right, you guys inside your hips gonna work? All right. So maybe Gabriel has to get over here. All right, so that holds it. So is it going to be longer?
44:22
Or is it going to be the end of 5? Maybe that's going to, okay? And then how do you know when it's ready to let? Go, if you want to go and you have to say it, Terry, you can say, I think it's not. Oh, you know what? Well, I won't be able to say it until you both tell me you're ready to get there.
44:47
Okay, so you both say, you say together, make sure We're ready. Three, two, one. Go. What had a crash? Take it over. It's oh well, you guys were trying to get her. If one crashes, did it. Do we take it over or what should we do? If one crashes, I didn't crash.
45:10
And so this one went longer. So we should we say this one, one. Or if it crashes to, we take it over. What do you guys think? Realty. Reese crash. We take it over. Okay, redo three, two over the tell me when you're ready. Where, ready? Three, two, one, go.
45:34
Okay. So which one went longer gave me? Yes. Looks like I think I agree. They were about the same fast. You agree, Julian, but one always longer now afterwards, right? I guess how? This one, this side. This one Friday. Oh,
