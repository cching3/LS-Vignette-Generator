    prompt = f"""Given a transcript where a teacher is working with a child with disabilities, please identify key moments that show the child engaging with support, struggling, or engaging spontaneously. 
            {data},

            First, number each moment clearly. 
            Then, for each moment, please format clearly and provide the following:

            1. Time Stamp and Location (if provided): Provide the exact time (e.g., 02:03 - 03:16) and location (if mentioned).


            2. Type of Challenge and Why: Red Stories: Struggling to engage, Blue Stories: Engaging with support, Green Stories: Doing it independently or spontaneously


            3. A Vignette or a summary of what is happening: e.g.
            "Child JG and adult are pretending to be mountain climbers. They are climbing to the top of the play structure, putting on their pretend skis, and then sliding down together. JG and adult are at the top of the play structure and JG slides down without the adult.  adult shouts after him ""Oh no JG! I only have one of my skis. One of them slid down without me! Can you bring it back up to me?"" JG returns to adult, and they pretend to find the lost ski together. 


            4. Daily Realities: What specific issue or behavior is being observed? e.g.
            "Child leaves the play without telling peers where they are going"


            5. Milestone and Bucket: given knowledge gotten from {{knowledge_base_results}}, relate the moment to a developmental milestone (e.g., "Imagining - Pretend Play") and explain how it connects to the childâ€™s current skills or abilities. Refer to knowledge from the provided dataset for context.


            6. Conclude on short tip for an educator like "Tip: Slow down the end of the play"
